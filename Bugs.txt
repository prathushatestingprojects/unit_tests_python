# ConvertToAtlasCopcoString
Method ConvertToAtlasCopcoString returns "ERROR:)" when passing 87 as parameter. 
Expected result is "Atlas" since 87 is divisible by 3. And the method doesn't return Atlas

Error:
 self.assertEqual(obj.ConvertToAtlasCopcoString(87),'Atlas')
AssertionError: 'ERROR:)' != 'Atlas'


# FindMax
This method returns 7 as the maximum between [1,5,-7] (should be 5 instead)
it captures the maximum after removing negative sign which is wrong!

Error:
 self.assertEqual(obj.FindMax([1,5,-7]),5)
AssertionError: 7 != 5
